  `It's the Tale of Three Wise Monkeys üôà üôâ üôä`,
  `Once upon of time in Edo period Japan, there was a wise Tendai Buddhist Monk who lives in a small shrine in Tochigi Prefecture.`,
  `The wise monk spends his life meditating, teaching and preserving Buddhism discipline to his followers and students in a small city called Nikko.`,
  `The wise monk has three students that each of them has specific traits and expertise.`,
  `Mizaru, the oldest and the first student, was the smartest of them. He was very good at reading and learning holy scriptures even understanding old Buddhist manuscripts.`,
  `Kikazaru, the second student, was the most physically fit of them. He was very good at meditating while balancing himself on a steep rock using only one foot.`,
  `Iwazaru, the third student, was not as smart or as fit as the other students. But he was very good at teaching Buddhism principles to the commoners.`,
  `The wise monk was very proud of his students with their individual traits and love them like they were his own children.`,
  `He don't see one of his student that he deemed was better than the others. He sees three of them as equally talented in nurturing themselves about Buddhism.`,
  `On one ordinary morning, after their morning meditation, the wise monk reveals a medium size wooden box in front of his three students.`,
  `"This box contains an old Buddhist manuscript explaining the ultimate wisdom of the world.", said the wise monk`,
  `Then he said, "One day when I deem that you're worthy of the wisdom, I'll let you read it."`,
  `The three students looked at each other and from their look, they were intrigued by contains of the box.`,
  `Months have passed by but the wise monk never reveal the contain of the wooden box to his students. He safely place the box on the tallest cupboard they have in the shrine.`,
  `"I really want to read the old manuscript that Sensei said contains the ultimate wisdom of the world.", whisper Mizaru to Kikazaru and Iwazaru when they do their morning routine.`,
  `"How can we read it without Sensei knowing of it?", continue Mizaru talking to Kikazaru and Iwazaru.`,
  `Kikazaru and Iwazaru looked at each other and they stood silence hearing Mizaru's idea while sweeping the floor of the shrine.`,
  `Then Iwazaru remember there's a Latern Festival at Lake Chuzenji which is near the shrine.`,
  `So they agreed to devise a plan to seek out the contain of the wooden box secretly while the wise monk went out of the shrine.`,
  `After their afternoon meditation, Iwazaru asked the wise monk if he was allowed to see Lantern Festival at the lake and wonder if the wise monk would accompany him.`,
  `The wise monk agreed innocently to Iwazaru's request and not knowing their secret plan to read the old Buddhist manuscript.`,
  `After the wise monk and Iwazaru left the shrine to see the Lantern Festival, Mizaru and Kikazaru carry out their plan to take the wooden box on top of the tallest cupboard`,
  `which is an easy task for Kikazaru considering his physical fitness. He took the wooden box from the top of the cupboard in one swift jump from the floor.`,
  `When he landed after his jump, he stared at the wooden box for a few seconds and gave it to Mizaru because he believed it's his right as the first student.`,
  `Mizaru gladly accept the honor for the first view of the old Buddhist manuscript inside the wooden box.`,
  `"The wooden box is strangely very light.", said Mizaru`,
  `When Mizaru opened the wooden box, he was shocked because the box was empty. He tried to grope the base and the lit of the box but he didn't found anthing`,
  `and then suddenly Mizaru and Kikazaru hear footsteps coming towards them.`,
  `It was the wise monk with Iwazaru standing beside him.`,
  `Before they can say anthing, the wise monk calmly took the wooden box from Mizaru's hand and place it on the table.`,
  `"There's no such thing as ultimate wisdom in this world or a shortcut to obtain it. Wisdom must be obtained.", explained the wise monk.`,
  `And then wise monk continued, "This was a test to know whether you are ready to spread and preserve the true meaning of Buddhism."`,
  `"A true Buddhism disciple must relinguish themself from worldly things.", the wise monk continue explaining.`,
  `The three students apologize to their Sensei by bowing down.`,
  `The wise monk realised that his beloved students are not ready to venture on their own.`,
  `He understood that his students were kept too long inside the shrine and have forgoten on how to resist the wordly temptation.`,
  `The wise monk then close both of his hands together and both of his eyes.`,
  `The three students can hear some  mystical enchantment from the wise monk and then suddenly...`,
  `"POOF !". The three students have been transformed into three monkeys with each specific traits.`,
  `"The three of you must atone your mistakes by going on a journey as monkeys to collect wisdom from the human world.", explained the wise monk.`,
  `"Mizaru, you will atone your mistakes by collecting wisdom without eyesight.", said the wise monk to Mizaru.`,
  `"Kikazaru, you will atone yourself by gathering wisdom without any hearing.", said the wise monk to Kikazaru.`,
  `"Iwazaru, you will relinquish yourself by seeking wisdom without the ability to speak.", said the wise monk to Iwazaru.`,
  `"We'll see each other again when you've collect enough wisdom and understand the true meaning of Buddhism."`,
  `THE END üôà üôâ üôä`,
  `If you go to Tosho-gu Shrine near this Ryokan, you'll see the carvings of the three wise monkeys inside the shrine.`,
  `It's said to this day the three students are still collecting wisdom from the human world.`,
  `But what do I know about wisdom. I'm just an old drunk hahaha üò¥ üç∂`,
  `[Would you go to the Tosho-gu Shrine ?]`,
